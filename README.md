# Wine Journal Application/Back-end

This is part of a full-stack project utilizing Rails and ActiveRecord to create API as well as buidling front-end from Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Handlebars. Within this application, user is able to sign-up and create an account. Once signed-in,
user is able to create new journal entries for each wine they'd like to have a record of.
Aside from creating, they are also able to update, delete, and view each entry of
their choosing. As a result, it is a complete REST-ful API.

### Process and planning

For this project, I worked with simple user stories and wireframes. The wireframes
have since changed from its original conception. A lot of the workflow is modeled
after the previous front-end project I recently completed. A lot less syntax error
this time around. Still plenty of bugs but I was able to use the error messages
more to my use. I find that I'm able to articulate the underlying programming
concepts more this time around. The issue queue was much easier to use because I knew
how to better communicate my problems.

### Items to work on for future iterations

..* Additional resources within database with many-to-many relationships
..* `OpenReadController` class so that users are able to share the wine resource with others.
